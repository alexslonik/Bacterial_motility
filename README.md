There are three notebooks in the repository.

The "Video Research" notebook is needed for primary video processing, obtaining particle trajectories, and validating the obtained trajectories. It contains the necessary comments - it is better to start video research with it.

The "File Comparison" notebook is needed to build comparative histograms. The "File Creation" notebook is needed to process a large number of files at once and is suitable for calculating heavy videos and/or calculating on weak computers.
